## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

**Lab 3, Part 2**

* Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite of mine as it was one of our first introductions to implementing math in our code. I was able to make it so our program could hande calculations based on the users input, no matter how vast apart the days were. I found the end result, the terminal printing how far apart two days where, to be fascinating. This lab taught me how to successfully implement calculations into my code.


**Lab 6, Part 2**

* Lab 6, part 2 was my favorite as I have very fond memories of playing Blackjack with my family as a child, and was excited to see what writing was behind the C++ version we were going to create. I was able to write ‘if’ statements, and how to incorporate calling variables within those statements. It was troubling at first, but once I was able to call a variable successfully, repeating the process was simple. The lab taught me how to successfully call both variables and functions.


**Lab 8, Part 2**

* Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite as I enjoyed seeing the output directly in the terminal, and the functions and loops that went behind creating the image. I was able to write loop patterns, and made it so said loops would run for a certain period of time before the next loop would begin. It took some time to understand how to work with loops, but this lab taught me how to successfully write a working loop function.
